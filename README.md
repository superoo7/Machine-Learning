# Machine Learning and Data Science
This repositories is actually from the course [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning), but I wanted to add in a bit on doing this on MATLAB since I had been using it for a while.

* Software used:-
	* Rstudio
	* Spyder
	* iTerm
	* MATLAB / Octave
